# YOLO RealTime UIKit Tests

This directory contains [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) for the YOLO RealTime UIKit example application, designed to ensure the reliability and functionality of the app's components.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

Follow these instructions to set up and run the tests for the application.

### Prerequisites

To execute these tests effectively, you will need the following [Apple Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) model file:

-   `yolo11n.mlpackage` - An [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/) model.

**Note**: This model file is not included in the repository due to its potentially [large size](https://git-lfs.com/), which can complicate version control.

### Obtaining the Model File

1.  Download [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) models from the official [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
2.  Convert the downloaded model (e.g., `yolo11n.pt`) to the Core ML format using the [Ultralytics `export` mode](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/export/):

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the YOLO11 nano detection model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Export the model to Core ML format
# See https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/coreml/ for more details
model.export(format="coreml")
```

### Adding Model Files to the Project

**IMPORTANT**: The model file (`yolo11n.mlpackage`) must be added to the **main application target** (`YOLO-RealTime-UIKit`) within your [Xcode project](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), not just the test target. This ensures the model is accessible within the main application bundle.

Follow these steps to add the model file correctly:

1.  Drag and drop `yolo11n.mlpackage` into your Xcode project navigator.
2.  In the "Choose options for adding these files" dialog:
    -   Ensure the checkbox for the "YOLO-RealTime-UIKit" target (the main app target) is checked.
    -   Optionally, check the "YOLO-RealTime-UIKitTests" target, but remember the main target is crucial.
    -   Select the "Create folder references" option (indicated by a blue folder icon). This helps maintain project organization.
3.  Click "Finish" to complete the process.

For optimal project structure, consider placing the model file within a dedicated "Models" group in your Xcode project.

The testing framework relies on accessing models from the main application bundle ([`Bundle.main`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle)), hence the requirement to include models in the main target for tests to function correctly.

### Testing Strategy

These unit tests are designed to verify several key aspects of the application:

-   **Model Initialization and Loading**: Ensures models load correctly and are ready for inference.
-   **Camera Session Configuration**: Validates the setup of the [camera session](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession) for real-time video input.
-   **UI Component Functionality**: Tests the behavior and state of [UI components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) used in the app.
-   **Real-time Inference Processing**: Checks the pipeline for processing frames and performing [model inference](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference).

#### Running Tests Without Models

By default, the `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS` flag in the test files is set to `true`. This configuration allows you to run a subset of tests without needing the actual `.mlpackage` model files. These tests focus on verifying the basic functionality, setup, and UI interactions of the application, making them suitable for quick checks or [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/) environments where model files might not be readily available.

#### Running Tests With Models

To execute the complete test suite, including tests that depend on the actual model performing inference:

1.  Ensure you have added the required `yolo11n.mlpackage` file to the **main application target** as detailed in the "Adding Model Files to the Project" section.
2.  Locate the test file (e.g., `YOLORealTimeUIKitTests.swift`) and change the `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS` flag to `false`.
3.  Run the tests again using Xcode's testing tools (Cmd+U).

This tiered testing approach ensures that both fundamental application logic and model integration can be thoroughly validated, offering flexibility based on whether the large model files are present.
