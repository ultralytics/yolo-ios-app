# YOLO Package Examples

Welcome! This directory contains example Xcode projects demonstrating how to integrate the Ultralytics YOLO Package into your iOS applications. Explore how to leverage [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) models for various [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) tasks directly on Apple devices.

## üöÄ Examples

We provide several sample apps built with both [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) to illustrate different use cases:

### YOLO-Single-Image-SwiftUI

- A straightforward SwiftUI application demonstrating inference on a single image selected from the user's photo library using an [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) Core ML model.

### YOLO-Single-Image-UIKit

- A simple UIKit application showcasing inference on a single image chosen from the photo library, powered by an Ultralytics YOLO Core ML model.

### YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUI

- An example SwiftUI app performing real-time [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), segmentation, or other tasks using the device's camera feed.

### YOLO-RealTime-UIKit

- An example UIKit app implementing real-time inference from the live camera stream.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Follow these steps to get the examples up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-ios-app.git
    cd yolo-ios-app/ExampleApps
    ```

2.  **Open an Example Project:** Navigate to the desired example directory (e.g., `YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUI`) and open the `.xcodeproj` file in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

3.  **Add a YOLO Core ML Model:** Drag and drop your chosen `.mlpackage` or `.mlmodel` file into the Xcode project navigator. Ensure it's added to the target membership of the application.

    #### Obtaining YOLO Core ML Models

    You have two primary ways to get Ultralytics YOLO models in [Core ML format](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/coreml/):

    - **Download Pre-Exported Models:** Download optimized Core ML [INT8](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-quantization) models directly from the [Ultralytics YOLOv8 GitHub releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/releases). Place the downloaded model file into your Xcode project.
    - **Export Your Own Models:** Use the [`ultralytics` Python package](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/) to export models tailored to your needs. This offers flexibility in choosing model types and configurations.

    - Install the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):

      ```bash
      pip install ultralytics
      ```

    - Run a Python script to [export](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/export/):

      ```python
      from ultralytics import YOLO
      from ultralytics.utils.downloads import zip_directory


      def export_and_zip_yolo_models(
          model_types=("", "-seg", "-cls", "-pose", "-obb"),
          model_sizes=("n", "s", "m", "l", "x"),
      ):
          """Exports YOLO11 models to CoreML format and optionally zips the output packages."""
          for model_type in model_types:
              imgsz = [224, 224] if "cls" in model_type else [640, 384]  # default input image sizes
              nms = True if model_type == "" else False  # only apply NMS to Detect models
              for size in model_sizes:
                  model_name = f"yolo11{size}{model_type}"
                  model = YOLO(f"{model_name}.pt")
                  model.export(format="coreml", int8=True, imgsz=imgsz, nms=nms)
                  zip_directory(f"{model_name}.mlpackage").rename(f"{model_name}.mlpackage.zip")


      # Execute with default parameters
      export_and_zip_yolo_models()
      ```

      - Locate the exported `.mlpackage` file in your working directory (or the directory specified in `export`) and add it to your Xcode project. Learn more about [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

4.  **Configure Signing:** In the project settings under "Signing & Capabilities", select your development team.

5.  **Build and Run:** Select a connected physical iOS device (iPhone or iPad) and click the Run button (‚ñ∂) in Xcode.

**Important Notes:**

- Real-time examples require a physical device with a camera; they **cannot** be run on the iOS Simulator.
- The examples use local Swift Package dependencies defined within the repository. Opening multiple example projects simultaneously might cause Xcode to have trouble resolving these packages. Please open and work with one example project at a time for the best experience.

## ‚úÖ Testing

Each example app includes [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) to verify its core functionality. These tests are located within the corresponding `Tests` directory (e.g., `YOLO-Single-Image-SwiftUITests`).

### Running Tests

1.  Open the desired example project in Xcode.
2.  Select the Test navigator (diamond icon).
3.  Choose the test target (e.g., `YOLO-Single-Image-SwiftUITests`).
4.  Run tests using `Cmd+U` or by clicking the play button next to the test target or individual tests.

### Test Configuration

- **Without Models:** By default, tests are configured to skip model-dependent checks (`SKIP_MODEL_TESTS = true` in the test files). This allows verifying basic UI and logic without needing the potentially large Core ML model files, useful for quick checks and some [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/continuous-integration-ci) setups.
- **With Models:** To perform comprehensive testing including model inference:
  1.  Ensure the required Core ML model(s) are added to the main application target (refer to the specific `README.md` within each test directory for details on required models). You can obtain models as described in the [Usage section](#obtaining-yolo-core-ml-models).
  2.  Set `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS = false` within the relevant test file(s).
  3.  Run the tests again.

Please consult the `README.md` file inside each example's `Tests` directory for detailed instructions on required models, obtaining/exporting them, and the specific functionalities covered by the tests.
