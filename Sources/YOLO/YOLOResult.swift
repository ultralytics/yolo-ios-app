//  The YOLOResult and related structures define the data models for storing and processing
//  the output from YOLO model inference. This includes bounding boxes for object detection,
//  masks for segmentation, probability distributions for classification, keypoints for pose estimation,
//  and oriented bounding boxes for rotated object detection. These structures maintain the
//  results in a consistent format across different tasks, making it easier to process and
//  visualize the information in the application's UI components.
