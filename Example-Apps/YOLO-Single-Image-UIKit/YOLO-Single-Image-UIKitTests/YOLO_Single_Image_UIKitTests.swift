/// of the app, including model initialization, image processing, and UI interactions.
///
/// - Note: These tests require the application to be built with testing enabled.
/// - Important: Some tests may require access to the photo library or camera.

    // Write your test here and use APIs like `#expect(...)` to check expected conditions.
