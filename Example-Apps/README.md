# YOLO Package Examples

Here are examples of how to use YOLOPackage in an Xcode project that demonstrate how to use YOLO CoreML in your app for Detect, Segment, Classify, Pose, and Obb tasks.

## Examples

There are currently four sample apps.

### YOLO-Single-Image-SwiftUI

A simple SwiftUI example that uses a YOLO CoreML model to infer an image selected from a photo library.

### YOLO-Single-Image-UIKit

A simple UIKit example that uses a YOLO CoreML model to infer an image selected from a photo library.

### YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUI

A simple sample app for real-time camera inference using SwiftUI.

### YOLO-RealTime-UIKit

A simple sample app for real-time camera inference using UIKit.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open the Xcode project of the sample app you want to use.

3. Drag and drop the YOLO CoreML model file you want to use into your Xcode bundle.

4. Select your account from Signing & Capabilities.

5. Build the app on a real device by clicking the Run button in Xcode.

**Note:**

The real-time inference app cannot be run on a simulator because it uses a camera.

The sample app uses local packages, so if you open multiple sample apps at the same time, the app may not be able to find the local packages. Open them one at a time.

## Testing

Each example app includes a suite of unit tests that verify its functionality. The tests are designed to run both with and without model files to support different development and CI scenarios.

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Open the example app project in Xcode
2. Select the test target (e.g., YOLO-Single-Image-SwiftUITests)
3. Press Cmd+U or select Product > Test from the menu

### Test Configuration

By default, tests are configured to run without requiring model files by setting `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS = true`. This allows testing basic functionality without needing the large CoreML models.

If you want to test with models:

1. Add the appropriate CoreML models to the main application target (see each test's README for specific model requirements)
2. Set `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS = false` in the test file
3. Run the tests again

See the README.md in each test directory for detailed instructions on:

- Which model files are required for full testing
- How to obtain and convert models
- How to properly add models to the project
- What functionality is being tested
