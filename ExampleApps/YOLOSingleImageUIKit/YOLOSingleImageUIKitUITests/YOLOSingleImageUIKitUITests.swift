/// It tests the app's UI workflow, including image selection, processing, and result display.
/// The tests ensure that the app's interface responds correctly to user interactions and
/// displays expected visual elements.
///
/// - Note: UI tests launch the actual application and simulate user interaction.
/// - Important: These tests require a device with camera and photo library permissions.
