//  The RemoteModels file defines a registry of downloadable YOLO models available for each task type.
//  It provides a structured mapping between task categories (detection, segmentation, classification, etc.)
//  and the available models with their remote download URLs. These models are presented to users in the
//  application interface, allowing them to download and use additional models beyond those bundled with
//  the application. The dictionary structure enables easy filtering of models by task type and provides
//  all necessary information for the ModelDownloadManager to retrieve and install the models.
