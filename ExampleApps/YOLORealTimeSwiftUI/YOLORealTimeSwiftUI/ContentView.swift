//  The ContentView demonstrates how to implement real-time object detection using the YOLOCamera
//  SwiftUI component. It shows how to create a full-screen camera view that performs continuous
//  object detection with a specified YOLO model. This example specifically uses the oriented
//  bounding box (OBB) model variant, but can be easily modified to use other model types like
//  detection, segmentation, or pose estimation by changing the task parameter and model name.
//  The view ignores safe areas to provide a full-screen camera experience.
