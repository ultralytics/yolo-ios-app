//  The YOLOTask enum defines the different types of computer vision tasks that the YOLO models can perform.
//  Each task represents a distinct type of machine learning capability, from basic object detection to
//  more advanced tasks like instance segmentation, pose estimation, oriented bounding box detection,
//  and image classification. This enum is used throughout the application to configure the model loading
//  and inference pipeline for the specific task selected by the user.
