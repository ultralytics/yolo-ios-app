//  The Predictor protocol and related interfaces define the contract for all YOLO model prediction
//  implementations. This includes methods for processing images and camera frames, as well as
//  listener protocols for receiving prediction results and performance metrics. The protocol-based
//  design enables a consistent API across different model types (detection, segmentation, classification)
//  while allowing for specialized implementations. Error types related to prediction processes
//  are also defined here, providing standardized error handling throughout the application.
