# YOLO RealTime SwiftUI Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the YOLO RealTime SwiftUI example application, designed to verify its core functionalities using [Xcode's testing framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest).

## üß™ Running Tests

### Prerequisites

To execute the complete test suite, including those involving model inference, you need the following [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) model file:

-   `yolo11n-obb.mlpackage` - An [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) model optimized for Oriented Bounding Box ([OBB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/obb/)) detection.

**Note**: This model file is not included in the repository due to its size.

### Obtaining the Model File

1.  Download pretrained Ultralytics YOLO models from the [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
2.  Convert the desired PyTorch model (`.pt`) to Core ML format (`.mlpackage`) using the Ultralytics `export` mode. See the [Export documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/export/) for more details.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained OBB model (e.g., yolo11n-obb.pt)
model = YOLO("yolo11n-obb.pt")

# Export the model to Core ML format
model.export(format="coreml") # Creates yolo11n-obb.mlpackage
```

### Adding Model Files to the Project

**IMPORTANT**: The `.mlpackage` file must be added to the **main application target** (`YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUI`), not just the test target. The testing framework loads models from the main application's bundle (`Bundle.main`).

Follow these steps to add the model file correctly within Xcode:

1.  Drag and drop the `yolo11n-obb.mlpackage` file into your Xcode project navigator.
2.  In the "Choose options for adding these files" dialog:
    -   Ensure the **"YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUI"** target checkbox is **checked**.
    -   Optionally, check the "YOLO-RealTime-SwiftUITests" target, but the main target is essential.
    -   Select the **"Create folder references"** option (indicated by a blue folder icon). This helps maintain the project structure.
    -   Ensure **"Copy items if needed"** is checked.
3.  Click "Finish".

For better organization, consider placing the model file within a "Models" group in your project structure. Refer to Apple's guide on [adding resources to your project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-resources-to-your-project) for more details.

The application framework specifically looks for models within the main application [bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle), hence the requirement to include them in the main target for tests to access them correctly.

### Testing Strategy

These tests aim to verify several aspects of the application:

-   **Model Initialization**: Checks if the Core ML model can be loaded correctly.
-   **Camera Functionality**: Ensures the camera preview starts and functions as expected within the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) view.
-   **UI Layout**: Verifies basic UI elements are present and responsive.
-   **Inference (Optional)**: Performs basic checks on the model's inference output if the model is available.

#### Running Tests Without Models (Default)

By default, the `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS` flag in the test file is set to `true`. This configuration allows you to run the tests **without** needing the `yolo11n-obb.mlpackage` file. Tests that depend on actual model inference will be skipped, but basic application functionality (UI, camera setup) will still be verified. This is useful for quick checks or in Continuous Integration (CI) environments where managing large model files might be complex.

#### Running Tests With Models

To run the full test suite, including tests that perform inference:

1.  Ensure you have obtained `yolo11n-obb.mlpackage` and added it to the **main application target** as described above.
2.  Open the relevant test file (e.g., `YOLO_RealTime_SwiftUITests.swift`).
3.  Change the flag `SKIP_MODEL_TESTS` to `false`.
4.  Run the tests using Xcode (Product > Test or `Cmd+U`).

This flexible approach ensures that both core application logic and model integration can be tested effectively, accommodating different development and testing scenarios.
