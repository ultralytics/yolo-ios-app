//  Threshold Provider for Ultralytics YOLO App
//  This class is designed to supply custom Intersection Over Union (IoU) and confidence thresholds
//  for the YOLOv8 object detection models within the Ultralytics YOLO app. It conforms to the MLFeatureProvider protocol,
//  allowing these thresholds to be dynamically adjusted and applied to model predictions.

//
//  The ThresholdProvider class enables fine-tuning of detection sensitivity and precision by modifying the
//  IoU and confidence thresholds, which are crucial for balancing the detection accuracy and the number of false positives.
